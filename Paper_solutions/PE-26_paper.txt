(To say this could be easily done with pen and paper is a stretch, but it doesn't require programming.)

The longest recurring cycle a number N can have is N - 1. I'm pretty sure only a prime N can have an (N - 1)-digit recurring cycle, though clearly this isn't the case for all primes. I don't know how to distinguish which primes *do* have (N - 1) digits without actually checking cycle itself.

7, 17, 19, 23, ...

OEIS says these are called full reptend primes (for base 10):

We need the largest number from the sequence above that is under 1000, so 983.

How would I find it without looking it up on OEIS?

Start with a list of every prime under 1000, which can be gotten from other sources or tediously calculated:

997, 991, 983, 977, ..., 7, 5, 3, 2.

Find the period of each number in the list above (e.g. by putting "1 / N" into WolframAlpha) and stop when we've gotten to the first one that is N - 1.

1 / 997 has a period of 166
1 / 991 has a period of 495
1 / 983 has a period of 982  ==>  Stop, that's the one. The answer is 983.
