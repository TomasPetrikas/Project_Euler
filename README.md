# Project_Euler

These are Python solutions for the first 50 problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives). I did these circa 2017, back in high school. Some of the solutions have been slightly modified, updated for Python 3, and/or improved on, but they're mostly still the same as they were originally.

Hoping to do these same 50 problems in C at some point, but we'll see if I get around to it.
