# Project_Euler

These are Python solutions for the first 50 problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives). I did these circa 2017, back in high school. Some of the solutions have been slightly modified, updated for Python 3, and/or improved on, but they're mostly still the same as they were originally.

I also have a few "pen and paper" solutions for some of the early problems that require no programming, only some calculations and maybe referencing [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) or [OEIS](http://oeis.org/). It's possible to do a lot more of them without programming, but a) it gets insanely tedious and b) I'm not a mathematician.

Hoping to do these same 50 problems in C at some point, but we'll see if I get around to it.
